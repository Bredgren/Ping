    <h1>Feedback instructions</h1>
    <p>
      This game is currently a work in progress and feedback of any kind is welcome. Probably the easiest thing to do would be to send me a message over facebook. If you found the link in a message I wrote than you can respond to that, or you can find my page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/brandon.edgren.5">here</a> and just send me a message directly.
    </p>

      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I'm pretty sure the game only works in Chrome right now. It doesn't work at all in IE and the display is weird in FireFox.
        </li>
        <li>
          I know it is possible to get the ball stuck behind the paddle, but I made it so that it won't continue to score while it is stuck.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h2>Control panel</h2>
      <p>
        There should be a control panel in the upper right which you can use to modify a few of the game's behaviors if you want to. If you decide to do so then here are things to know (otherwise you may press the 'h' key to completely hide them).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All parameters except for "ball_type" take effect immediately.
        </li>
        <li>
          Changes to "ball_type" will take effect each round.
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm mostly interested in your experience with "ball_type" 0 (the circle ball) but feel free to play around with the others you want.
        </li>
        <li>
           Play with the numbers and tell me what you liked best. If you know why you liked it then that helps too.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
